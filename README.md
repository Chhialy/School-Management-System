## Installation & local setup


1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Chhialy/School-Management-System.git
cd "School-Management-System"
```

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add your MongoDB connection string

```text
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/<database-name>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=replace-with-a-secret
```

For local development with a local MongoDB instance you can use:

```text
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/school-management
```

1. Run the app

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## API endpoints

- Health: `GET /api/health`

Students (examples):

- `GET /api/students` ‚Äî list students
- `POST /api/students` ‚Äî create student
- `GET /api/students/:id` ‚Äî get student
- `PUT /api/students/:id` ‚Äî update student
- `DELETE /api/students/:id` ‚Äî delete student

Teachers and Courses follow the same pattern under `/api/teachers` and `/api/courses`.

Example student object shape:

```json
{
  "studentId": "S-001",
  "name": "Alice Example",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "phone": "123-456-7890",
  "grade": "10",
  "address": "123 Main St"
}
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` ‚Äî start development server
- `npm run build` ‚Äî production build
- `npm start` ‚Äî start production server
- `npm run lint` ‚Äî run ESLint

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository
1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
1. Commit your changes
1. Push and open a PR

## Troubleshooting

- If MongoDB connection fails, double-check `MONGODB_URI` and Atlas IP access list
- If build errors occur, remove the `.next` folder and reinstall dependencies
